            <p>
              Pose estimation of deformable objects is a fundamental
              and challenging problem in robotics. We present a novel
              solution to this problem by first reconstructing a 3D model
              of the object from a low-cost depth sensor such as Kinect,
              and then searching a database of simulated models in different
              poses to predict the pose. Given noisy depth images from 360-
              degree views of the target object acquired from the Kinect
              sensor, we reconstruct a smooth 3D model of the object using
              depth image segmentation and volumetric fusion. Then with an
              efficient feature extraction and matching scheme, we search the
              database, which contains a large number of deformable objects
              in different poses, to obtain the most similar model, whose
              pose is then adopted as the prediction. Extensive experiments
              demonstrate better accuracy and orders of magnitude speedup
              compared to our previous work. An additional benefit of
              our method is that it produces a high-quality mesh model
              and camera pose, which is necessary for other tasks such as
              regrasping and object manipulation.

              Deformable objects such as garments are highly
              unstructured, making them difficult to recognize and manipulate.
              In this paper, we propose a novel method to teach a two arm
              robot to efficiently track the states of a garment from an
              unknown state to a known state by iterative regrasping. The
              problem is formulated as a constrained weighted evaluation
              metric for evaluating the two desired grasping points during
              regrasping, which can also be used for a convergence criterion
              The result is then adopted as an estimation to initialize
              a regrasping, which is then considered as a new state for
              evaluation. The process stops when the predicted thin shell
              conclusively agrees with reconstruction. We show experimental
              results for regrasping a number of different garments including
              sweater, knitwear, pants, and leggings, etc.</p>

            <p>
              Robotic manipulation of deformable objects remains
              a challenging task. One such task is to iron a piece of
              cloth autonomously. Given a roughly flattened cloth, the goal
              is to have an ironing plan that can iteratively apply a regular
              iron to remove all the major wrinkles by a robot. We present a
              novel solution to analyze the cloth surface by fusing two surface
              scan techniques: a curvature scan and a discontinuity scan. The
              curvature scan can estimate the height deviation of the cloth
              surface, while the discontinuity scan can effectively detect sharp
              surface features, such as wrinkles. We use this information to
              detect the regions that need to be pulled and extended before
              ironing, and the other regions where we want to detect wrinkles
              and apply ironing to remove the wrinkles. We demonstrate
              that our hybrid scan technique is able to capture and classify
              wrinkles over the surface robustly. Given detected wrinkles, we
              enable a robot to iron them using shape features. Experimental
              results show that using our wrinkle analysis algorithm, our
              robot is able to iron the cloth surface and effectively remove
              the wrinkles.
